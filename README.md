# Project work N2 (Yandex Praktikum) - How To Study

## A project that help students improve their web developer skills.
Such as:
 * layout blocks and elements on web page
 * embed third-party web objects
 * make transform and transition effects
 * make keyframes and animation on pages
 * do other interesting stuff

_In addition to teaching students, the text of the project contains interesting observations and facts from the history of the learning process itself._

## Plans to improve my work project:
 * Change some modificators and make them more independent and then use them globaly for mix with blocks and elements
 * Import or link other fonts to project
 * Add vendors prefix for better compatibility with different browsers
 * Make some forms for feedbacks
 * Make a more complete readme file
